stead of high-entropy universes transferring energy directly, dark energy originates from quantum fluctuations at the multiversal boundary. This energy “leaks” into young universes, driving their expansion. The dying universe does not directly pass energy; instead, its collapse triggers the boundary conditions that produce dark energy.
